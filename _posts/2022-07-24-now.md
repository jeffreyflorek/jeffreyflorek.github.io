I'm currently living in New York City with my spouse, Jackie, and our senior chihuahua, Deno.

This is how I spend my time:

- Working as a Sales Engineer in the Building Automation industry;
- Training to run my first half marathon (Queens Half Marathon --- November 20, 2022!); and
- Trying to make this website look even somewhat acceptable.

My current priorities in life are:

- Being a supportive partner;
- Finding time to learn, pursue hobbies, and to be more creative in general;
- Daily movement/exercise;
- Self care, including eating healthy and sleeping well; and
- Reducing the amount of stress I carry around with me.

I'm always looking to broaden my horizons and work on novel projects. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work with me on anything!

This is a living document, I'll add and remove activities and priorities as my life changes. The last update was **July 24, 2022**.

_This page is a reminder to myself of my current priorities as well as a public declaration of what I'm currently working on. It was inspired by <a href="https://thomasjfrank.com/now/">Thomas Frank's page of the same name</a>._
